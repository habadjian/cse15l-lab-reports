* Next, open Visual Studio Code and open the terminal by pressing (Ctrl or Command + `) or by clicking the terminal icon at the top then **"New Terminal"**.
Here is an example:

* Once your terminal is open, type in this command ```ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu```. Remember to replace "zz" with your specific username. If it's your first time logging in, you'll see a quesion asking you if you want to connect. Answer "yes" and you're good to go. After answering "yes", enter your password(don't worry if nothing shows up) and you should see this:

* Great job! You are now connected to one of the computers in the CSE basement.

## Step 3: Running Commands

* Some basic commands everyone should know when using a terminal are:
1. **ls** - lists everything in the current directory
2. **cd** - changes directory to home if nothing is typed afterwards
3. **ls -lat** - lists everything in long format, lists hidden directories, and lists the time of the last edit 
4. **cp** copies files to another place (must have permission to read the file)
5. **cat** - prints the files contents to the terminal
6. **mv** - moves file from current directory to another
