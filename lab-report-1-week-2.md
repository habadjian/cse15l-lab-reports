* Once your terminal is open, type in this command ```ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu```. Remember to replace "zz" with your specific username. If it's your first time logging in, you'll see a quesion asking you if you want to connect. Answer "yes" and you're good to go. After answering "yes", enter your password(don't worry if nothing shows up) and you should see this:

* Great job! You are now connected to one of the computers in the CSE basement.
